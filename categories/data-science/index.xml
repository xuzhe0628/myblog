      <description>Math for Data Science Review This article is based on Coursera course Math for Data Science provided by Duke University. To better understanding the algorithms in data mining, machine learning and deep learning, I write this summary to go through the basic math that will be used.
Sets A set means a collection of some elements. For example, a basket of vegetables.
Cardinality is the size of a set. It means the number of elements in the set.</description>

      <description>Type Name Definition Comments     Classification Accuracy number of correctly identified instances / all instances Not ideal for skewed data. Not ideal for situations that you care one classification more than the rest. For example, if you create a model to predict cancer, you may care more about whether the people have cancer other than he does not.   Classification Precision True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) Out of all the items labeled as positive, how many truly belong to the positive class.</description>

      <description>Some variables used in the cheat sheet.
clf # the model that we trained X_test # the test dataset y_test # the target of the test dataset  Preprocessing Dataset Split training dataset test_size decides the proportion of instances split from the training set as test data. random_state decides whether the data is randomly chosen.
from sklearn import cross_validation X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=0)  Evaluation Metrics Confusion Matrix from sklearn.</description>
