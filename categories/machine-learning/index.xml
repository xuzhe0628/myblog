      <description>Bias Bias due to a model being unable to represent the complexity of the underlying data. A high Bias model is said to underfit the data.
Bias occurs when a model has enough data but is not complex enough to capture the underlying relationships. As a result, the model consistently and systematically misrepresents the data, leading to low accuracy in prediction. This is known as underfitting. Simply put, bias occurs when we have an inadequate model.</description>
